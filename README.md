# gulp-localize-html
[![Commitizen friendly][commitizen-badge]][commitizen]

This plugin is designed to translate HTML by extracting keys from the DOM and translating them using configurable callbacks. The default set-up should work for a lot of static sites, but it should be very easy to configure to your needs.
